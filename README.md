# toDo-List
This responsive To-Do List application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, update, and remove tasks. A key feature is the ability to edit tasks directly by double-clicking on them. The design includes a subtle box-shadow animation that adds a modern and dynamic look to the interface. All tasks are stored locally, ensuring they persist even after the browser is closed.
